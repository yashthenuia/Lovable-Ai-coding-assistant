🛠️ Coder Buddy
Coder Buddy is an AI-powered coding assistant built with LangGraph.
It works like a multi-agent development team that can take a natural language request and transform it into a complete, working project — file by file — using real developer workflows.

🏗️ Architecture
Planner Agent – Analyzes your request and generates a detailed project plan.
Architect Agent – Breaks down the plan into specific engineering tasks with explicit context for each file.
Coder Agent – Implements each task, writes directly into files, and uses available tools like a real developer.
